---

## Variables

1. Must start with a lowercase letter or `_`.
2. Can end with `!` or `?`

```lost
nothing := nil
something: Number = 123
_private_thing := "Yes"
tested? := false
```

## Functions

1. Must start with a lowercase letter or `_`
2. The function body is surrounded with `{}` braces
3. The arguments are declared before the arguments/body delimiter `;`
4. The body comes after the arguments/body delimiter `;`
5. The last expression is the return value
6. Return early using `return` keyword

```lost
# func_name { [args]; [body] }

func_with_args { arg1, arg2 := 1, etc := true;
    # body
}

without_args {;
    # body
}

add { a, b;
    a + b
}
add(4, 8)  # 12

_privately_do { x, y, z; }
```

## Labeled & Named Function Arguments

**Labels** — a param declared as two identifiers in a row (`label name`) can be called `label: value`. Matches by position, never reorders. Opt-in per call; wrong label raises `Argument_Label_Mismatch`.

```lost
send_message { to person, saying text;
    "To `person`: `text`"
}

send_message(to: 'Jack', saying: 'Found fresh water')  # positional and labeled both work
send_message('Sayid', 'Meet at the caves')
```

**Named arguments** — `name := value` at a call site binds by the callee's declared param name, order-independent. Positional args (bare or labeled) must come first; once you name one, the rest must be named too.

```lost
sub { a, b; a - b }

sub(a := 1, b := 2)   # -1
sub(b := 2, a := 1)   # -1 reordered, same result
sub(1, b := 2)        # -1 positional then named is fine

# sub(a := 1, 2)       raises Positional_Argument_After_Named
# sub(a := 1, a := 2)  raises Duplicate_Named_Argument
# sub(a := 1, c := 2)  raises Unknown_Named_Argument
# sub(1, a := 2)       raises Argument_Given_By_Name_And_Position
```

**Struct-typed params** — `: <...>` instead of a plain type name checks *structurally*, not by name: any argument that has each listed member, with a compatible type, is accepted. `Any` matches any member type. Checked on every call, raising `Type_Contract_Violation` on a mismatch.

```lost
f { right: <name: String, type: Any, value: Any>; right.name }

m := Member('x', String, 4)
f(m)     # 'x' -- Member isn't named in the annotation, it just has all three members
f(nil)   # raises Type_Contract_Violation
```

## Recursion

A named function is registered in its enclosing scope as it's declared, so it can call itself.

```lost
factorial { n;
    if n == 0 or n == 1
        1
    else
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
}
factorial(8)  # 40320

fib { n;
    if n <= 1
        n
    else
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
}
fib(10)  # 55

fizz_buzz { n;
    if n % 15 == 0
        'FizzBuzz'
    elif n % 3 == 0
        'Fizz'
    elif n % 5 == 0
        'Buzz'
    else
        n.to_s()
    end
}

for 1...15
    @puts fizz_buzz(it)
end
```

## Forward Declarations

Calling a function, or referencing a type, works even before its own declaration is reached in the file — including mutual recursion between two functions declared in either order.

```lost
result := main()   # `main` hasn't been declared yet, but this still works

main {; helper() }
helper {; 42 }

result  # 42
```

```lost
is_even { n;
    if n == 0
        true
    else
        is_odd(n - 1)
    end
}

is_odd { n;
    if n == 0
        false
    else
        is_even(n - 1)
    end
}

is_even(4)  # true
```

A class-styled alias (`This := That {}`) hoists the same way, since it's declaring a type just spelled through an assignment:

```lost
p := This()

This := That {}
That { greet {; 'hi' } }

p.greet()  # 'hi'
```

A bare `@load` hoists too, so imports can live at the bottom of the file instead of the top:

```lost
sign := Div([P('hi')])
sign.to_s()  # '<div><p>hi</p></div>'

@load 'lost/html.tape'
```

`Ident := @load 'file'` / `IDENT := @load 'file'` work the same way — only a Capitalized or UPPERCASE left-hand name opts in, since that's what marks it as a namespace rather than an ordinary variable:

```lost
sign := Html_Lib.Div([Html_Lib.P('hi')])
sign.to_s()  # '<div><p>hi</p></div>'

Html_Lib := @load 'lost/html.tape'

# html_lib := @load 'lost/html.tape'   -- lowercase stays a plain variable, not hoisted
```

Plain variable assignments are never hoisted this way — reading one before its own line has actually run still raises `Undeclared_Identifier`, same as any language with top-to-bottom execution:

```lost
@puts "`a`"   # raises Undeclared_Identifier
a := 123
```

## Classes

1. Must start with an uppercase character
2. Can have an initializer `new`

```lost
My_Class {
    input,
    
    new { input;
        self.input = input  # self is the current instance, like this in other languages
        @puts 'Initted with "`input`"'
    }
}

instance := My_Class('some input')  # Initted with "some input"
```

## Constants

1. Must be UPPERCASE
2. Cannot be reassigned after initial declaration

```lost
PI := 3.14159
MAX_SIZE := 100
APP_NAME := 'My App'
```

## Comments

```lost
# This is a single-line comment
# Stack a few of these for a multi-line comment

###
Or wrap a whole block in ###/### -- everything in between is discarded,
including lines of code, so it doubles as a way to comment out code.
###

####
A longer run of #s on the outer marker can safely nest a same-length
or shorter ### inside it, since only a marker at least as long as the
opening one closes the block -- the same rule ``` fences use to nest.
### this looks like a comment but it's just text in here ###
still inside the outer comment
####
```

## String Interpolation

1. Use backticks inside strings to interpolate expressions
2. Escape with backslash to prevent interpolation

```lost
name := 'World'
greeting := "Hello, `name`!"  # "Hello, World!"
math := "2 + 2 = `2 + 2`"    # "2 + 2 = 4"
escaped := "Literal \`backticks\`"
```

## Scope Operators

1. `self` accesses current instance scope only
2. `Self` accesses current type/class scope only
3. `~/` accesses global scope

```lost
My_Class {
    Self.count := 0   # Type-level (static) variable
    value,

    new { value;
        self.value = value   # Instance variable (like this.value in other languages)
        Self.count += 1      # Access static from instance
    }

    get_global {;
        ~/PI  # Access global scope constants
    }
}
```

## Static Declarations

1. Use `Self.` to declare type-level (static) members
2. Shared across all instances
3. Accessed on the type itself: `Type.member`

```lost
Counter {
    Self.count := 0

    Self.increment {;
        count += 1
    }

    new {;
        Self.count += 1
    }
}

Counter()
Counter()
Counter.count  # 2
```

## Type Composition

1. `|` union: merge all members from both types
2. `&` intersection: keep only shared members
3. `~` removal: remove members of right type from left
4. `^` symmetric difference: keep non-shared members

```lost
Movable {
    x := 0
    y := 0
    move { dx, dy;
        x += dx
        y += dy
    }
}

Drawable {
    color := 'black'
    draw {; "Drawing in `color`" }
}

# Combine types
Sprite | Movable | Drawable {
    name := 'sprite'
}

s := Sprite()
s.move(10, 5)
s.draw()
```

Composition chains, so `~` can remove a trait that was mixed in earlier in the same chain:

```lost
Flying { can_fly := true }
Swimming { can_swim := true }

Duck | Flying | Swimming { name := 'duck' }
d := Duck()
d.can_fly     # true
d.can_swim    # true

Ostrich | Duck ~ Flying { name := 'ostrich' }
o := Ostrich()
o.can_swim    # true
o.can_fly     # raises Lost::Undeclared_Identifier
```

A type can even compose with itself, to extend or override a built-in type's own behavior:

```lost
Array | Array {
    each { func;
        for self.values   # self.values reaches the original Array's own values, despite `each` itself now being redefined
            func(it)
        end
    }
}

values := Array([1, 2, 3])
doubled := []
values.each({ it;
    doubled.push(it * 2)
})
doubled  # [2, 4, 6]
```

## Conditionals

1. `if`/`elif`/`else`/`end`
2. `unless` is the negation of `if`
3. Can be used as inline modifiers
4. Any value works as a condition -- truthiness follows Ruby's own rules: only `nil`/`false` are falsy, everything else (`0`/`0.0` included) is truthy

```lost
if x > 10
    'big'
elif x > 5
    'medium'
else
    'small'
end

unless logged_in
    redirect('/login')
end

# Inline conditionals
@puts 'yes' if condition
@puts 'no' unless condition
```

## While & Until Loops

1. `while` loops while condition is true
2. `until` loops until condition becomes true
3. `elwhile` chains another loop when prior condition becomes false

```lost
i := 0
while i < 5
    @puts i
    i += 1
end

j := 0
until j == 5
    @puts j
    j += 1
end

# Chained loops with elwhile
x := 0
y := 0
while x < 4
    x += 1
elwhile y > -8
    y -= 1
else
    @puts 'done'
end
```

## For Loops

1. Iterate over arrays, ranges, or any iterable
2. `it` is the current element
3. `at` is the current index

```lost
for [1, 2, 3]
    @puts it      # Current element
    @puts at      # Current index
end

for 1...5
    @puts it      # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
end

# With stride (chunks)
for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] by 2
    @puts it      # [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
end
```

## For Loop Verbs

1. `map` transforms each element
2. `select` filters where body is truthy
3. `reject` filters where body is falsy
4. `count` counts where body is truthy

```lost
doubled := for [1, 2, 3] map
    it * 2
end  # [2, 4, 6]

evens := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] select
    it % 2 == 0
end  # [2, 4]

odds := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reject
    it % 2 == 0
end  # [1, 3, 5]

even_count := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] count
    it % 2 == 0
end  # 3
```

## Loop Control

1. `skip` continues to next iteration
2. `stop` breaks out of loop
3. `return` exits the function (propagates through loops)

```lost
for items
    skip if it.this     # Continue to next
    stop if it.that     # Break out
end

find_first { predicate;
    for items
        return it if predicate(it)
    end
    nil
}
```

## Readable and Writable Scopes

Every scope keeps two extra fallback places identifier lookup checks, after its own declarations — a **readable** scope (read-only) and a **writable** scope (also a fallback for writes) — making an instance's members accessible without an `instance.` prefix. Lookup order is always `[self, writable, readable]`: a scope's own declarations win first, then anything reachable through a writable scope, then a readable scope.

1. `@readable`/`@writable` in a function signature adds the argument to a readable/writable scope, making its members directly accessible in the function body
2. `@add_readable_scope instance` / `@add_writable_scope instance` manually add an instance to a readable/writable scope, in any scope; `@remove_readable_scope`/`@remove_writable_scope` take it back out
3. Both are held *weakly* — adding an instance doesn't keep it alive. Once nothing else refers to it, it's free to be garbage collected on its own, even though it's technically still "added". You only need `@remove_readable_scope`/`@remove_writable_scope` for explicitly taking something out early, not to avoid a leak
4. The standard library itself lives this way — `String`/`Array`/etc. are reachable through Global's own readable scope, not declared on Global directly. Reassigning a built-in name (`Array = Mine`) can never mutate the real one; it just shadows the name for the rest of your program

```lost
Vector {
    x := 0
    y := 0
}

# Auto-unpack in parameters
magnitude { @readable vec;
    (x ** 2 + y ** 2).sqrt()  # Access x, y directly
}

v := Vector()
v.x = 3
v.y = 4
magnitude(v)  # 5

# A writable unpack lets a plain write reach the unpacked instance's own member
double { @writable vec;
    x *= 2   # writes straight through to vec.x
    y *= 2
    vec
}
doubled := double(v)  # doubled.x: 6, doubled.y: 8

# Manual scope control
@add_readable_scope some_instance     # Add to readable scope
@remove_readable_scope some_instance  # Remove from readable scope
```

```lost
# The standard library works the same way -- Array is reachable through
# Global's own readable scope, not declared on Global directly
Mine | Array { extra := true }
Array = Mine          # shadows the name -- the real Array is untouched
[1, 2, 3].length()    # 3 -- still works, Mine composes Array
[1].extra              # true -- and every array literal now has this too
```

An unpacked instance stays visible to functions defined after the unpack, even nested ones:

```lost
Point {
    a := 0
    b := 0

    new { a, b;
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
    }
}

outer {;
    p := Point(23, 42)
    @add_readable_scope p

    inner {;
        a + b   # a, b resolved from p via the readable scope, despite being nested inside outer
    }

    inner()
}
outer()  # 65
```

## Reopening Scopes (`@push_scope`/`@pop_scope`)

1. `@push_scope <Type or instance>` pushes that scope directly onto the stack, so declarations made inside it become real members of the target
2. `@pop_scope <same target>` pops back to the previous scope — it asserts (by identity) that you're popping what you actually pushed, raising instead of popping the wrong thing
3. Unlike readable/writable scopes, `@push_scope` mutates its target — reopening a Type extends every instance of it, reopening a specific instance changes only that one

```lost
Button {
    label := 'default'
}

@push_scope Button
    css_filter := 'invert()'   # extends the Type itself
@pop_scope Button

b := Button()
b.css_filter   # 'invert()' — every Button gets it, since Button itself was extended

@push_scope b
    onclick := { @puts 'clicked' }   # modifies just this instance
@pop_scope b

c := Button()
c.onclick   # raises Lost::Undeclared_Identifier — only b was modified
```

## Arrays

1. Created with `[]` brackets
2. Access elements with subscript or dot notation

```lost
arr := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr[0]              # 1
arr.0               # 1 (dot notation)

arr.push(6)         # Add to end
arr.pop()           # Remove from end
arr.length()        # 5
arr.first(2)        # [1, 2]
arr.last(2)         # [4, 5]
arr.reverse()
arr.include?(3)     # true
arr.empty?()        # false

arr.map({ x; x * 2 })
arr.filter({ x; x > 2 })
```

## Dictionaries

1. Created with `{}` braces and key-value pairs
2. Keys can be symbols, strings, or identifiers
3. Access with subscript `dict[:key]`

```lost
dict := {x: 10, y: 20}
dict[:x]            # 10
dict[:z] = 30       # Assignment

dict.keys()         # [:x, :y, :z]
dict.values()       # [10, 20, 30]
dict.has_key?(:x)   # true
dict.count()        # 3
dict.empty?()       # false
dict.delete(:z)
dict.merge({a: 1})
dict.fetch(:missing, 'default')
```

## Strings

```lost
s := 'Hello, World!'
s.length            # 13
s.upcase()          # 'HELLO, WORLD!'
s.downcase()        # 'hello, world!'
s.split(', ')       # ['Hello', 'World!']
s.trim()            # Remove whitespace
s.chars()           # ['H', 'e', 'l', ...]
s.reverse()
s.include?('World') # true
s.start_with?('He') # true
s.end_with?('!')    # true
s.gsub('World', 'Lost')
s.to_i()            # Convert to integer
s.empty?()          # false
```

## Percent Literals

1. `%string(...)`/`%symbol(...)` turn space-separated bare items into a real Array of String/Symbol literals, preserving each item's own casing
2. `%str`/`%Str`/`%STR` force lower/Capital/UPPER casing on the strings; `%sym`/`%Sym`/`%SYM` do the same for symbols
3. Items can be identifiers, numbers, or operators, not just letters
4. A `` `expr` `` item (see Statement Expressions below) is evaluated immediately, like string interpolation, and folded through the same casing treatment as everything else

```lost
%string(boo Hoo COOL)      # [boo, Hoo, COOL]
%symbol(BOO hoo Cool)      # [:BOO, :hoo, :Cool]

%str(Boo hOO COOL)         # [boo, hoo, cool]
%Str(boo HOO cOOl)         # [Boo, Hoo, Cool]
%STR(boo Hoo cool)         # [BOO, HOO, COOL]

%sym(Boo HOO cOOl)         # [:boo, :hoo, :cool]
%Sym(boo HOO cOOl)         # [:Boo, :Hoo, :Cool]
%SYM(boo Hoo cool)         # [:BOO, :HOO, :COOL]

%string(boo 4815 + - *)    # [boo, 4815, +, -, *]

cool := 2342
%string(481516 `cool`)     # [481516, 2342] -- `cool` is interpolated, not stored as-is
```

## Statement Expressions

1. `` `expr` `` wraps any expression without running it -- an `Lost::Statement`, callable later with `()`
2. Written straight at a call site, `` `expr`() `` just evaluates immediately
3. Stored in a variable, it can be called any number of times -- each call re-evaluates the wrapped expression fresh, by default remembering the scope it was *built* in (a normal closure, no matter where `()` ends up being called from)
4. `.memoize = true` caches the first call's result instead of re-running every time
5. `.use_caller_scope = true` does the opposite of remembering -- resolves fresh against wherever `()` is actually called from

```lost
`1+2`()                    # 3 -- evaluated right away

x := `1+2`
x()                        # 3
x: Statement = `1+2`       # same thing, with an explicit type annotation

counter := 0
increment := `counter += 1`
increment()
increment()
increment()
counter                    # 3 -- each call actually re-ran the body

cached := `counter += 1`
cached.memoize = true
cached()                   # 4
cached()                   # 4 -- didn't run again
```

See `learn/statement_expressions.tape`/`learn/advanced_statements.tape` for the full picture, including `.use_caller_scope`.

## Numbers

```lost
n := 42
n.abs()             # Absolute value
n.floor()           # Round down
n.ceil()            # Round up
n.round()           # Round to nearest
n.sqrt()            # Square root
n.even?()           # true
n.odd?()            # false
n.to_s()            # '42'
n.clamp(0, 100)     # Clamp to range
```

## Ranges

1. `...` inclusive range
2. `..<` exclusive end
3. `>..` exclusive start
4. `>.<` exclusive both

```lost
1...5   #   1, 2, 3, 4, 5    (inclusive)
1..<5   #   1, 2, 3, 4       (exclusive end)
1>..5   #      2, 3, 4, 5    (exclusive start)
1>.<5   #      2, 3, 4       (exclusive both)

for 1...10
    @puts it
end
```

## File I/O

```lost
@load 'lost/file_system.tape'

content := File_System.read('./file.txt')
File_System.write_string_to_file('./out.txt', 'Hello!')
```

## @load Directive

1. Imports another Lost file
2. Files are only loaded once
3. Imports may be scoped by assigning the @load to a variable

```lost
@load 'lost/string.tape'
@load 'lost/array.tape'
@load './my_module.tape'
my_mod := @load './my_module.tape'
my_mod.Some_Type()
```

## @puts Directive

```lost
@puts 'Hello, World!'
@puts variable
@puts "Value: `expression`"
```

### Telling printed values apart

Lost's built-in collection types each wrap their printed contents in a different bracket, so you can tell what you're looking at at a glance:

```lost
@puts [1, 2, 3]      # [1, 2, 3]      -- Array
@puts (1, 2, 3)      # (1, 2, 3)      -- Tuple
@puts {x: 1, y: 2}   # {x: 1, y: 2}   -- Dictionary
@puts <1, 2, 3>      # <1, 2, 3>      -- Struct
```

A custom type prints as raw internals until it defines its own `to_s{;}` — see [Classes](#classes):

```lost
Point {
    x := 1
    greet {; 'hi' }
}
@puts Point()   # #<Lost::Instance name="Point" declarations=["name", "types", "x", "greet"]>
```

Nothing enforces a bracket convention for your own types, but picking one that doesn't collide with the built-ins above keeps output easy to scan.

## @declare Directive

1. Declares an identifier on the current scope from a runtime String name, rather than a literal identifier written in the source (what `:=` needs)
2. `@declare name` declares `nil`; `@declare name, value` and `@declare name, value, type` add a value and, optionally, a type
3. Passed a Struct instead of a name, spreads every *named* member onto the current scope in one go — each member's own name, value, and declared type carry over directly

```lost
@declare 'flare_count'          # flare_count == nil
@declare 'flare_count', 3       # flare_count == 3
@declare 'ration', 2, Number    # same as `ration: Number = 2`

supplies := <water: Number = 40, wood: Number = 12>
@declare supplies               # water == 40, wood == 12
```

## Web Server

1. Compose with `Server` type
2. Define routes with HTTP method syntax
3. Start with `@start` directive

```lost
@load 'lost/server.tape'

App | Server {
    new {;
        self.port = 3000
    }

    get:// {;
        'Hello, World!'
    }

    get://about {;
        'About page'
    }
}

@start App()
```

## Routes

1. HTTP methods: `get://`, `post://`, `put://`, `delete://`, `patch://`
2. URL parameters with `:param` syntax
3. Query params via `request.query`

```lost
App | Server {
    # Static route
    get://users {;
        'All users'
    }

    # URL parameter
    get://users/:id { id;
        "User `id`"
    }

    # Multiple params
    get://posts/:post_id/comments/:id { post_id, id;
        "Comment `id` on post `post_id`"
    }

    # Query strings: /search?q=term
    get://search {;
        query := request.query[:q]
        "Searching for `query`"
    }
}
```

## Request & Response

```lost
post://login {;
    username := request.body[:username]
    password := request.body[:password]

    if authenticate(username, password)
        response.redirect('/dashboard')
    else
        response.status = 401
        'Unauthorized'
    end
}

get://api/data {;
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    '{"status": "ok"}'
}
```

## Database

1. Use `Sqlite` for SQLite databases
2. Connect with `@connect` directive

```lost
@load 'lost/database.tape'

db := Sqlite('./data/app.db')
@connect db

db.create_table('users', {
    id: 'primary_key',
    name: 'String',
    email: 'String'
})

db.table_exists?('users')  # true
db.tables()                # ['users']
db.delete_table('users')
```

## Record ORM

1. Compose with `Table` type
2. Set static `Self.database` and instance `table_name` (or call `infer_table_name_from_class!()` to derive it, e.g. `User` → `'users'`)

```lost
@load 'lost/table.tape'

User | Table {
    Self.database := ~/db
    table_name := 'users'
}

# CRUD operations
User.create({name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com'})   # returns the created record
users := User.all()                          # Array of Dictionaries
user := User.find(1)                         # Dictionary
User.find_by({email: 'alice@example.com'})   # Dictionary, or nil
User.where({name: 'Alice'})                  # Array of Dictionaries
User.update(1, {name: 'Alicia'})
User.delete(1)
```

Records come back as Dictionaries for this plain pattern. Compose `Table` with a tagged reference instead (`Tasks | Table\<'tasks', Task> {}`) and every CRUD method returns a real `Task`-shaped Struct instead.

## HTML Elements

1. Compose with HTML element types from `lost/html.tape`
2. `css_*` prefix sets inline CSS properties
3. `html_*` prefix sets HTML attributes
4. `.to_s()` renders an element and its children to string directly

```lost
@load 'lost/html.tape'

Card | Div {
    css_padding := '1rem'
    css_border_radius := '8px'
    css_background_color := '#fff'

    html_class := 'card'
    html_data_value := 42
    html_aria_label,
}

Link | A {
    html_href = '#'
    html_target := '_blank'
}

page := Html([
    Head(Title('My Page'))
    Body([
        H1('Welcome')
        Card([
            P('Hello!')
            Link('Click me')
        ])
    ])
])
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic

```lost
+ - * / %     # Basic math
**            # Exponentiation
<< >>         # Bitwise shift / Array append
```

### Comparison

```lost
== !=             # Equality
< <= > >=         # Relational
<=>               # Spaceship (three-way)
=~ !~             # Regex match
=== =!=           # Composed-type-set equality
=>= =<=           # Composed-type-set superset (and its mirror) =>= means "left superset of right?", and its mirror
=/=               # Composed-type-set disjointness means they don't share anything
```

`===`, `=!=`, `=>=`, `=<=`, and `=/=` compare a type or instance's *composed types* — its own name plus everything it's picked up via `|`/`&`/`~`/`^` — rather than comparing values:

```lost
Flying { can_fly := true }
Swimming { can_swim := true }

Duck | Flying | Swimming { name := 'duck' }
Fish | Swimming { name := 'fish' }

Duck === Duck          # true  (identical composed types)
Duck === Fish          # false (Duck also composes Flying)
Duck =!= Fish          # true

Duck =>= Swimming      # true  (Duck composes with at least Swimming)
Swimming =>= Duck      # false
Swimming =<= Duck      # true  (=<= is =>= with the operands flipped)

Duck =/= Fish          # false (both compose Swimming — not disjoint)
Flying =/= Swimming    # true  (share nothing)
```

All five comparison operators also take [Structs](#structs) into account. An untagged type is treated as having no members, so plain comparisons like the ones above are unaffected:

```lost
Abc\<Number> {}
Abc\<Number> === Abc\<String>   # false — same composed type, different tag
Abc === Abc                     # true  — neither side tagged
```

`Any` is a universal wildcard for `==`/`!=`/`===`/`=!=`: anything that isn't `nil` counts as equal to it, no composition needed.

```lost
String === Any    # true
4 == Any          # true
nil == Any        # false — the one exception
```

### Logical

```lost
&& and        # Logical AND
|| or         # Logical OR
! not         # Logical NOT
```

### Assignment

```lost
:=            # Declaration — introduces a new identifier, infers and locks its type
=             # Assignment — requires the identifier to already be declared
+= -= *= /=   # Compound assignment
&&= ||=       # Logical compound
<<= >>=       # Shift compound
```

## Operator Overloading

1. Declare with `@operator`, a symbol or identifier, a fixity (`@infix`, `@prefix`, `@postfix`), a precedence number, and a function body
2. Overloads are stored as regular functions in the declaring scope, so they can be scoped to a single function without leaking out
3. Precedence controls how overloaded operators combine with each other and with built-ins
4. If a type declares its own overload for an operator, that always wins over a same-named overload declared elsewhere — dispatch is by the left operand's type first, falling back to whatever's in scope only if the operand doesn't have its own

```lost
# Redefine + only inside this function — everywhere else, + still adds
scoped := compute {;
    @operator + @infix 700 { left, right;
        left * right
    }
    3 + 4
}

3 + 4      # 7 (unaffected outside)
scoped()   # 12

# Build a pipeline operator
@operator -> @infix 300 { left, right;
    right(left)
}

double { n; n * 2 }
add_fifteen { n; n + 15 }

4 -> double -> add_fifteen  # 23

# Invent new literal syntax
Time { hour, minute, period, }

@operator : @infix 700 { hour, minute;
    t := Time()
    t.hour = hour
    t.minute = minute
    t
}

@operator pm @postfix 600 { left: Time;
    left.period = 'pm'
    left
}

11:22pm  # Time(hour: 11, minute: 22, period: 'pm')

# Or a prefix operator that builds a value from a bare literal
Currency { amount, name, code, }

@operator $ @prefix 900 { amount;
    c := Currency()
    c.amount = amount
    c.name = 'US Dollar'
    c.code = 'USD'
    c
}

$42  # Currency(amount: 42, name: 'US Dollar', code: 'USD')

# A type's own overload beats a same-named global one. A fresh symbol (~>, not ->) since
# declaring another global -> here would just overwrite the pipeline -> declared above it,
# in the same global scope.
@operator ~> @infix 300 { left, right; 999 }

Wrapped {
    val,
    new { v; self.val = v }
    @operator ~> @infix 300 { left, right; left.val }
}

a := Wrapped(42)
a ~> 1          # 42 — Wrapped's own ~> wins
5 ~> double     # 999 — global ~> still applies to everything else
```

## Runtime Type Contracts

1. `:=` infers a type from its right-hand side and locks the identifier to it
2. Subsequent `=` assignments are checked against that locked type; `:=` again re-infers and re-locks
3. A mismatch raises `Lost::Type_Contract_Violation`, not the static type checker's `Type_Mismatch`

```lost
x := 4        # declares x, infers Number, locks x to that type
x = 8         # ok — same type
x = 'hello'   # raises Lost::Type_Contract_Violation ("expected Number, got String")

x := 4
x := 'hello'  # fine — re-declaring with := re-infers and re-locks the type
x             # 'hello'

y = 4         # raises Lost::Cannot_Assign_Undeclared_Identifier — y was never declared
```

## Function Signatures

1. `{Param, Param -> Type;}` is a signature — a value describing a function's shape (its param types and return type), with no implementation — same `-> Type` placement a real function uses, just with no body
2. A real function always declares its own return type inside its body, with `-> Type` at the end of its param list before `;` — a self-declaring signature uses the same shape under its name (`double: {Number -> Number;}`)
3. Assigning a function to a signature-typed identifier checks its actual shape, not just a name — mismatches raise `Lost::Type_Contract_Violation`, the same runtime type contract `:=` uses
4. Any function with a declared return type is checked on every call — what it actually returns has to match, signature or not

```lost
Currency_Formatter := {Number -> String;}    # takes a Number, returns a String

format_usd { cents: Number -> String;
    "$" + (cents / 100.0).to_s()
}

format_eur { cents: Number -> String;
    "€" + (cents / 100.0).to_s()
}

formatter: Currency_Formatter = format_usd
formatter(1050)               # "$10.5"

formatter = format_eur        # ok — same shape: (Number) -> String
formatter(1050)               # "€10.5"

formatter = { cents; cents }  # raises Lost::Type_Contract_Violation — wrong shape
```

A declared return type is enforced on its own, with no signature involved:

```lost
lying { a -> Number; 'not a number' }
lying(5)   # raises Lost::Type_Contract_Violation — declared Number, actually returned String
```

## Structs

1. `<...>` attaches runtime-inspectable metadata (a struct) to a standalone value or a reference to an existing type. Tagging a *Type* declaration/reference itself uses `\` instead, to stay unambiguous with a plain struct value and with comparisons — `Array\<String> {}` (inline literal), or `Array\Task_Schema {}`/`Array\String {}` (a named reference to an already-declared struct or Type)
2. Each declared tag is its own type — `Abc\<Number> {}` and `Abc\<String> {}` don't share `new`/methods
3. A reference matches a declared tag by type (like overload resolution), including types it composes and not just its own name. Referencing a real Type with no matching variant yet auto-declares one; referencing anything else with no match raises `Lost::Undeclared_Type_Structure`
4. Reachable through `.tag` (`.tag.types`, or `.tag.some_name` for named members) — bound before `new{;}` runs, never forwarded as constructor args
5. Naming an *undeclared* identifier with bare `<...>` (no `\`, e.g. `Named<...>`) builds a plain, named struct instead of raising — a name that's already taken by a real Type still takes priority and behaves as above

```lost
String\<dict: Dictionary> {
    to_s {; "dict: `tag.dict`" }
}
String\<num: Number> {
    to_s {; "number: `tag.num`" }
}

String\<{x=1}>().to_s()   # "dict: {x: 1}"
String\<5>().to_s()       # "number: 5"

Thing := <String, Number>   # anonymous struct -- .name is nil
n := Named<String, Number>  # bare <...>, no `\` -- Named is undeclared, so this builds a plain named struct instead
n.name                      # 'Named'
```

## Enums (not finalized — don't rely on yet)

```lost
Task_Type [
	TODO
	BUG,
	DONE: Priority             # type-annotated -- still Symbol-valued, annotation is metadata only
	CANCELLED: Priority = 99   # type-annotated with an explicit value
	ARCHIVED := 'archived'     # self-declared value, no annotation
]

Task_Type.TODO      # :TODO
Task_Type.keys      # [TODO, BUG, DONE, CANCELLED, ARCHIVED]
Task_Type.count     # 5
```

Enums are syntactically present but not finalized: each member's `: Type` annotation is parsed and stored, but not enforced — nothing raises if a value doesn't match its declared type. The older forced-type spelling (`TYPE_IDENT :: Type { ... }`) no longer exists. Don't rely on Enum type-checking yet.

## Shorthand Nil-Initialization

Trailing comma declares variable as nil if undefined. 

```lost
Type {
	undefined_var,      # equivalent to `undefined_var := nil`	
}

here_too,               # here_too := nil
```

A bare annotated identifier with nothing assigned behaves the same way — no need to write `= nil` just to make an already-self-declaring annotation (`x: Number`, or a struct annotation) actually declare something:

```lost
thing: <String, Number>   # same as thing: <String, Number> = nil
thing                     # nil

x: Number                 # same as x: Number = nil
x                         # nil
```
